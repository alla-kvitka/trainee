There is Spring Boot project with the set of sensor data files in "src/main/resources/sensors" folder (in .json format).

1. Create endpoint that can return list of sensors from "src/main/resources/sensors".
Also, endpoint should accept the set of parameters:
- sensor type (not required)
- min battery percentage (not required)
- status: Online/Offline (required)

2. Create endpoint that generates sensors report and save it to the "src/main/resources/reports" folder.
Report should be in .json format and have the next structure:
- the number of all sensors in "src/main/resources/sensors"
- the number of broken sensors
- the number of online sensors

Pay attention:
- there is broken sensor in "src/main/resources/sensors", please handle such case;
- there are sensors with wrong fields in "src/main/resources/sensors", please handle such cases;
- please write unit tests;
- please make the code production ready as much as possible;
- you can use any additional libraries;
- please publish the result on GitHub.
